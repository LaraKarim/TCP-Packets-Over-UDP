# TCP-Packets-Over-UDP
Designed and implemented a system that simulates TCP packets using a UDP connection by extending the user space of your application while maintaining reliability and supporting the HTTP protocol on top of UDP. Handle errors such as invalid packets, timeouts, and connection termination gracefully by checksum.
